In this video I develop a simple application with Angular 6 CLI (Command Line Interface), manage the source code on GitLab and deploy it to a cloud server using AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service).

This video was the first youtube video I recorded, so I've had some inexperience. I apologize in advance for the noise in the background. It's recovering from the 10th minute.

If you want to apply the steps in the video one by one, you should be having NPM and Angular CLI installations. For doing that, you can make use of the following commands:

For npm setup: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

For Angular CLI setup:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

##### Technologies and products referred to in the video:

- TypeScript
- Angular 2+
- Angular CLI
- GitLab CI
- Docker
