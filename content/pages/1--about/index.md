I have started my career in 2010 as an Enterprise Java ( J2EE ) Software Engineer. In 2013 I became an Oracle Certified Java Professional. For the last five years, I have been developing Web & Mobile Applications using modern frameworks and languages such as React, Angular 2+ ES6 JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, Ionic and React Native. I like working with Agile Scrum, TDD and BDD.

My consultancy company is called LucidCode Ltd. I work as a self employed contractor. Previously my company operated in Istanbul with 5 employees and provided IT contract services with me and my team of 5 Developers for more than 30.000 hours in 5 years. Now I continue my work with my UK Company. For IT contract work opportunities, please [contact me](mailto:omerg@lucidcode.com.tr)
